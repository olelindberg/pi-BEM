Authors should use this document as a template. The Title is mixed case (initial capitals followed by lower case on all words except articles, conjunctions, and prepositions, which should appear entirely in lower case). The Abstract is a brief description of the entire paper, including the scope, the methodology and the key conclusions. It should be no longer than 250 words. The Abstract is followed by a list of up to six keywords, each separated by semi column. The Nomenclature follows after the list of keywords. Symbols should be in italic and listed in alphabetical order. First include Roman symbols, then Greek symbols, and finally the list of acronyms in Roman font. When the subscripts are made of more than one letter, use Roman font, otherwise use Italic (for example, I\_beam and I\_x). The units of all symbols should be included in squared brackets without using fractions and separated by a space (for example, m s-1), while acronyms should not have units and should not be used in equations.

\noindent {\bf Keywords}: keyword 1; keyword 2; keyword 3; keyword 4; keyword 5; keyword 6.

\section{DOUBLE BODY MODEL}
The hydrodynamic interaction force between a ship and other ships, the seabed, banks or fixed structures is strongly related to pressure changes due to increased or decreased flow velocity around the ship. The physical problem resembles that of a Venturi pipe. A mathematical model for calculation of a ships hydrodynamic interaction forces should capture the the Venturi pipe effect between the ships. Fortunately thats excately what the \emph{double body flow model} does. In the double body flow model is to assume that the free surface is flat and the body is mirrored the body and solution around
the still water level.
The double body flow model is based on potential flow theory, hence the water is assumed to be in-
compressible, inviscid and irrotational, and where the fluid velocity is the gradient of the velocity potential $\V{u} = \nabla \phi$. 
Mass conservation is satisfied through the Laplace equation for the velocity potential
\begin{equation}
	\nabla^2 \phi = 0, \quad z \in [-h,\eta],
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the sea depth and $z = 0$ is still water level. At the seabed the no-flux boundary condition applies
\begin{equation}
	\V{n} \cdot \nabla \phi = 0, \quad z = -h, 
\end{equation}
where $\V{n} = [n_x, n_y, n_z]^T$ is the normal vector to the seabed, pointing out of the fluid and into the seabed. Likewise are submerged bodies subject to the no-flux boundary condition
\begin{equation}
	\V{n} \cdot \nabla \phi = n \cdot \V{V} , \quad (x, y, z) \in S_B, 
\end{equation}
where $\V{n}$ is the normal vector pointing out of the fluid and into the body, $\V{V} =\V{u}_B + \V{\omega}_B \times \V{r}$ and $\V{u}_B$ and $\V{\omega}_B$ are the linear and rotational velocities of the body, $\V{r}$ is the direction vector from $CG$ and $S_B$ is the submerged surface of the body. A ship navigating in an open sea has the far-field boundary condition [9]
\begin{equation}
	\phi = \mathcal{O} (\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) \quad \mathrm{for} \quad x^2 + y^2 \rightarrow \infty. 
	\label{eq_farfield}
\end{equation}
Conservation of momentum of a inviscid and irrotational fluid flow is described by the Bernoulli equation. In a ship fixed moving frame of reference, where the Bernoulli constant is zeros due to the far-field condition \eqref{eq_farfield}, it is
\begin{equation}
	p(x, y, z) = -\rho \left(\D{\phi}{t} -\V{V} \cdot \nabla \phi + \frac{1}{2} \nabla \phi \cdot \nabla \phi + gz \right).
	\label{eq_bernoulli}
\end{equation}
The hydrodynamic force on the submerged body is
\begin{equation}
	\V{F} = \int_{S_B} p(x, y, z) ~\V{n} dS.
	\label{eq_hydrodynamic_pressure_force} 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Linearization and pertubation expansion}
First we Taylor expand the velocity potential around the still water level, $z_{SWL}$,
\begin{equation}
	\phi(x,y,z) = \phi(x,y,z_{SWL}) + \eta \left.\D{\phi}{z}\right|_{x,y,z_{SWL}} + \mathcal{O}(\eta^2),
	\label{eq_phi_tay_exp}
\end{equation}
where the free surface elevation is $\eta = z-z_{SWL}$. Secondly, both the velocity potential and free surface elevation are perturbation expanded due to a small parameter $\varepsilon$
\begin{align}
	\phi = \phi_0 + \varepsilon \phi_1 + \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2), \label{eq_phi_per_exp} \\
	\eta = \eta_0 + \varepsilon \eta_1 + \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2).\label{eq_eta_per_exp}
\end{align}
Insertion of the expansions \eqref{eq_phi_tay_exp}, \eqref{eq_phi_per_exp} and \eqref{eq_eta_per_exp} in the Bernoulli equation \eqref{eq_bernoulli} and keeping only the zero'th order terms gives
\begin{equation}
	p(x, y, z) \approx -\rho \left(\D{\phi_0}{t} -\V{V} \cdot \nabla \phi_0 + \frac{1}{2} \nabla \phi_0 \cdot \nabla \phi_0 + gz \right),
	\label{eq_bernoulli_exp}
\end{equation}
and evaluation of this at the free surface, where the atmospheric pressure is assumed to be zero, and keeping only the zero'th order terms gives
\begin{equation}
	\eta_0 =  \frac{1}{g} \left(\D{\phi_0}{t} -\V{V} \cdot \nabla \phi_0 + \frac{1}{2} \nabla \phi_0 \cdot \nabla \phi_0\right).
\end{equation}
Now the surface integral for hydrodynamic force is split into the part under $SWL$ and the variation from $SWL$ due to $\eta$
\begin{align}
	\V{F} &= \int\limits_{S_{B,SWL}} p(x, y, z) ~\V{n} dS + \int\limits_{ S_B\backslash S_{B,SWL}} p(x, y, z) ~\V{n} dS.
\end{align}
The latter integral is simplified by insertion of the expanded pressure \eqref{eq_bernoulli_exp} and the vertical integration limits from $z_{SWL}$ to $z_{SWL}+\eta_0$
\begin{align}
	\V{F} &= \int\limits_{S_{B,SWL}} p(x, y, z) ~\V{n} dS + \frac{1}{2}\rho g\int  \eta_{0,y<0}^2 ~dx- \frac{1}{2}\rho g\int\eta_{0,y>0}^2 ~ dx.
\end{align}



\subsection{Sub-Headings}

Sub-headings are numbered, mixed case (initial capitals followed by lower case on all words except articles, conjunctions, and prepositions, which should appear entirely in lower case), and bold.

\subsubsection {Additional Sub-Headings}

Additional sub-headings should be numbered, mixed case and bold.

\section{ARTICLE FORMAT}
\subsection{Page Setup and Page Numbers}

The margins of this template are as in Table 1. The page numbers format is as in Table 2.

\subsection{Equations}

Equations must be included using the command Equation in the tab Insert. Please use punctuations as appropriate together with the equations (see examples below). Equations should be numbered consecutively using numbers enclosed in parentheses. The equation number can be added including \# followed by the equation number between parentheses at the end of the equation. For example, within the Equation environment, typing a=b,\#(1) and hitting return results in:
\begin{equation}
Ax = b
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where the meaning of each symbols such as $a$ and $b$ should be defined in the text before or immediately after, such as here, when they are used for the first time. Another example is as follow. The drag coefficient, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
C_D=\frac{1.328}{\sqrt{Re_L}},
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}
depends on the Reynolds number, $Re_L$, based on the ship length $L$.

 Use the Equation environment also in the main text to avoid that the symbols appear with different fronts in the equation and in the text (for example, $a$ vs a, and $L$ vs L). Every symbol must also be included in the Nomenclature at the beginning of the article.

\subsection{Tables}

 Tables are numbered consecutively and captioned. The caption title is bold followed by full stop (e.g. \textbf{Table~1}), all caption is 11 points and centered above the table.

 The body of the table is 11 points. Tables are positioned within the body of the article, centered, and as close as possible to the place where they are first discussed. Bold and colored shading can be applied.

 \begin{table}[h!]
\caption{This is an example of a table showing the template margins.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{{l}p{0.2in}{l}}
Top & &2.5 cm \\
Bottom && 2.5 cm \\
Left && 2.0 cm \\
Right && 2.0 cm \\
Gutter && 0.0 cm \\
Header && 1.0 cm \\
Footer && 1.0 cm \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Page numbers format.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lp{0.2in}l}
Position & &Bottom of the Page \\
Alignment & &Center \\
Number on first page && Yes \\
First page number && 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Figures}

 The Author should make every effort to include figures of memory size small enough so that the document size is manageable for downloading and opening over the internet and, at the same time the resolution of the figures is adequate for printing.

 All figures should be numbered consecutively and captioned. The caption should be 11 point bold, placed below the figure (as opposite to table captions that are placed above the table).

 Figures should be positioned within the body of the article, centered, and as close as possible to the place where they are first discussed. Wrapping style should be ``in line with text''. Color graphs, photos and animations are encouraged.

 IMPORTANT: text within the figure should be no smaller than 9 points, and the symbols should appear with the same font type as in the Nomenclature.

 Equations, figures and tables can be referenced in the text such as, for instance, equation 1, Eq. 1, Eqs. 1 and 2, Eqs. 1-3, Fig. 1, Figs. 1a and 1b (for multiple sub-figures), Tab. 2, \textit{etc. }

 When necessary, use Column Break to keep the caption with its table or figure on the same page.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=11cm]{fig-example.eps}
\caption{Example of a figure.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Citations}

 When the citation is part of the sentence, the citation includes the Author's last name and, between parentheses. For example, Bowman (1988) showed that this is a good citing style. Conversely, when the citation is not part of the sentence, then also the Author's name is within parentheses  (Bowman, 1988). Append lower-case letters to the year in cases of ambiguity (Bowman, 1989a). Multiple Authors are treated as Bowman and Skipper (1988) when there are two Authors and, in the case of three or more Authors, we list only the first Author followed by \textit{et al. }in italic. For example, see Bowman \textit{et al.} (1988). Multiple citations that are not part of the sentence should be separated by semicolons  (Bowman 1989; Skipper 1990).
